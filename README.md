[00:14.75] It's like we became strangers
[00:18.87] I don't recognize us
[00:21.67] Something isn't right here, right now
[00:26.34] I liked you for years
[00:29.07] I've had enough
[00:36.37] I've had enough
[00:58.18] (Searching for)
[00:59.43] Let's go (you)
[01:06.43] 
[01:13.23] (Searching for)
[01:14.48] Let's go (you)
[01:28.26] (Searching for you)
[01:37.76] 
[01:47.02] And every time that we touch
[01:49.37] And every time I feel it in your eyes
[01:52.32] I like the way you try to have me for you
[02:02.46] A proof that you were here
[02:06.10] A proof that you existed
[02:09.87] I hope they lead to you
[02:12.94] I pray you search me too
[02:17.26] (I keep on searching for you)
[02:19.27] Purara-pa-pa
[02:21.01] (I keep on searching for you)
[02:22.89] Purara-pa-pa
[02:24.73] (I keep on, I keep on)
[02:26.52] Purara-pa-pa
[02:28.37] (Searching for)
[02:29.32] Let's go (you)
[02:36.32] 
[02:38.13] (Searching for you)
[02:39.54] (Searching for you)
[02:41.44] (Searching for you)
[02:43.29] Searching for you
[02:51.79] 
[03:13.49] (Searching for you)
[03:17.29] (Searching for you)
[03:19.06] (Searching for you)
[03:20.76] (Searching for you)
[03:22.63] (Searching for you)
[03:24.54] (Searching for you)
[03:26.34] (Searching for you)
